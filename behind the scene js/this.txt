this keyword/variable: Special variable that is created for every execution context (every function). Takes thhe value of (poits to) the "owner" of the function in which the this keyword is used


these are the methods to call this
methods 👉 this = < Object that is calling the method>

1)Simple function call 👉 this = undefined(in strict mode or in the browser)

2)Arrow functions 👉 this = <this of surrounding function (lexical this)>

3)Event listener 👉 this = <DOM element that the handler is attached to >




☝️This does NOT point to the function itself, and also NOT the its variable environment
